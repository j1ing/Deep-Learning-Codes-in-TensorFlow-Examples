# Deep-Learning-Codes-in-TensorFlow-Examples
This project is targeting people who are interested in or studying deep learning.

The neural network templates here are not design to have high performance and accuracy,
rather it gives simple examples for different algorithm with TensorFlow.

When it is possible, I use the same dataset for different algorithms to show comparison.

I upload a a plot of accuracy and loss for each training example.
